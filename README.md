## template notes

- This template already has express and sequelize with migrations (see `20210421044032-create-examples.js`)
- For the purpose of this exercise, you can use the db specified in `expense.json`
- Feel free to directly connect to this db and make any changes you like (for example, with the `mysql` command)
- You can find sample data in `expenses.csv`. This is fake data to help you get started. Feel free to generate your own.
- The preferred stack for solving this problem is express, sequelize, and mysql, but if you get stuck, feel free to use what you're familiar with.
